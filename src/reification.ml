     and where REL is constrained by the current mode:
     - should be [elem R] for the considered chain element [R] with `Accumulate
     - should be [b (elem R)] for the considered chain element [R] with `By_symmetry
     
     such a type [e] is interpreted as a bisimulation candidate

     returns a tuple [(r,c,x,q)] where
     - [c] has type [reification.T] and is the skeleton of the bisimulation candidate
     - [x] has type [reification.fT a c] and are the elements related by the bisimulation candidate
     - [q] is a function making it possible to reconstruct a nice type for the goal resulting from the application of the considered lemma.
     
     the key invariant is that [e] should be convertible to [pT a c r x]

     in the above example,
     - [c] is [abs (fun x => abs (fun y => abs (fun _: P x y => cnj hol (abs (fun z => hol)))))]
     - [x] is [fun x y H => ((u,(v,tt)), fun z => (p,(q,tt)))]

     the OCaml type of [g] is a bit complicated: [bool -> int -> (int -> constr) -> constr]
     intuitively, [g true i REL'] should be [e] where [REL] has beend replaced by [REL']
     the integers are there to deal with de Bruijn indices:
     - in the `PTower case, [REL'] will constructed from the context so that integers will just be ignored 
     - in the `By_symmetry case, [REL'] involves a [mkRel] whose index depends on the depth at wich it gets replaced; [i] is used to record the current depth 
     the Boolean is only used for the `By_symmetry mode: setting it to false makes it possible to reverse all pairs in the candidate

        1. We would like to do just
        [Tactics.apply (by_symmetry a c x b)]
        unfortunately, this does not seem to trigger typeclass resolution for instantiating the next two arguments of [by_symmetry] (the function s, and a proof of [Sym_from converse b s])
        Thus we use [eapply] instead, and we perform an explicit call to typeclass resolution for the first generated subgoal. 

        2. The unification problem seems to be more difficult here, and [eapply] fails unless we convert the goal first into its reified form.
        Using [refine (by_symmetry a c x b _ _ _ _)] works in Ltac, but it's painful to provide a term with holes in OCaml - at least I don't know how to do it nicely.
        Whence the first two steps.

        3. after eapplying [by_symmetry], we get three subgoals and we want to
        - run typeclass resolution on the first one
        - do a change with nice types on the second and third ones 
        I don't know how to get access to those three goals separately (e.g., the tclTHENLAST tacticial has a different type than the tclTHEN I'm using here...), so that I take a look at the resulting goals to recognise who is who.
