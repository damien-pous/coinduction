(** * Tactics for coinductive n-ary relations *)

(**
we provide three tactics:
- [coinduction R H] to start a proof by coinduction 
  [R] is a name for the bisimulation candidate,
  [H] is an introduction pattern for the properties of the candidate
- [accumulate H] to accumulate new pairs in the bisimulation candidate
  [H] is an introduction pattern, as above
- [symmetric] to reason by symmetry when the coinductive (binary) relation is defined by a symmetric function.
  this tactics makes it possible to play only half of the coinductive game, provided it manages to prove automatically that the candidate is symmetric.
  A tactic [tac] for solving the symmetry requirement may be passed as follows:
  [symmetric using tac]
  (by default, we use solve[clear;firstorder])

(** * Arities and relations *)
(** we call 'relations' elements whose type is of the shape
    - [X1 -> X2 -> ... -> Xn -> Prop]
    - or more generally, [forall x1: X1, forall x2: X2, ..., Xn -> Prop]
    those are reified via the definition [REL] below, using "arities" of the shape
    - [ABS X1 (fun _ => ABS X2 (fun _ => ... (ABS Xn (fun _ => PRP))))]
    - [ABS X1 (fun x1 => ABS X2 (fun x2 => ... (ABS Xn (fun _ => PRP))))]

| ABS(B: Type)(Q: B -> Arity).
Arguments ABS _ _: clear implicits.

Fixpoint REL' A K :=

    [R] should be understood as the bisimulation up-to candidate.
    [H] expresses the pairs [R] is assumed to contain.
    Note the move to [b `R] in the conclusion: now we should play at least one step of the coinductive game for all pairs inserted in the candidate.

(** we use the OCaml defined [apply_ptower] tactic, whose role is:
    - to parse the goal to recognise a bisimulation candidate
    - to `apply' [reification.ptower] with reified arguments corresponding to that candidate
    - to `change' the new goal to get rid of the reified operations and get back to a goal resembling the initial one

This is why we spend time in OCaml to reconstruct a type for the new goal by following syntactically the initial one.)
